citra emulator
==============
[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/citra-emu/citra.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/citra-emu/citra)

An experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++. At this time, it only emulates a very small subset of 3DS hardware, and therefore is only useful for booting/debugging very simple homebrew demos. Citra is licensed under the GPLv2. Refer to the license.txt file included. Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/FAQ) before getting started with the project.
